# Research plan and vision

I believe that the ML research community at UiT is at a crossroads. On one hand many big projects are coming in, and the general research community is really opening its eyes towards the power of machine learning. On the other hand, there are still many basic research questions within machine learning that require careful and long-term work. Juggling these two, sometimes opposing, forces is no simple task. 

The challenge is thus to combine continued knowledge growth with applications that have real impact. 

The latter will also include working towards innovation and commercialization. 

To be more concrete I would like to:
- continue the ongoing collaboration with UNN.
- continue my ongoing project with detecting logical fallacies.
- continue my 

### Research plans complementary to _Visual Intelligence_

- Images and text -- contextual information.
- Generative models -- Model the data and create additional synthetic data for improved training. 
- Adversarial (and other) approaches in machine learning within healthcare. The robustness of a decision support system can be measures by its resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, these attacks can be used to further analyse the machine learning tools so that they are more easily adapted by clinicians. A concrete example could be _how much can we change each feature before the class output changes_?
- I am already involved in a startup and that experience will be important to support the _innovation_ aspect of the Visual Intelligence center.
