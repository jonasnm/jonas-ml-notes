# Description of research

>Description of your research stating which works you consider most important and a brief description of the other listed works

During my career at UiT I have been a part of several research projects in addition to starting some of my own. To give a quick summary I am simply listing the current research directions I am pursuing (followed by a more detailed description of some of them below):

1. Detecting logical fallacies in text using transformer models.
2. Analysis of medical health records, both through NLP (transformer models) and other more traditional ML techniques
3. Generative models
   - PhD work
   - Bayesian Deep Learning -- reversible jump, and other transdimensional algorithms, for generative models.
   - Properties of ReLU Neural networks -- frequency bias in generative models and the implications of overconfidence of neural network predictions in reinforcement learning. 
4. Reinforcement Learning -- hierarchical reinforcement learning and applications in Type 1 Diabetes.
