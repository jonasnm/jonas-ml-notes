# Application letter

I am hereby applying for the position as associate professor in Machine Learning at UiT the Arctic University of Norway.

I am currently working in the UiT machine learning group as a researcher and I am actively involved in the group, arranging group meetings, supervising master's and PhD students and applying for research funds. To be able to continue this in a permanent position where I can also teach, supervise and contribute on all levels is something I would very much like to do. 

If given the opportunity, I believe I am a good candidate for this position. I have supervised student on all levels, I have been in charge of several courses as well as given individual special curriculums for masters students. I have a network of international collaborators and actively and successfully been engaged in seeking external funding. 

Furthermore, given the dramatic increase in size of the UiT Machine Learning Group, I have been heavily involved in the organization and day to day management of the research group, giving me unique insight into how the research group as well as the faculty and institute administrations function. 

<!-- When it comes to SFI Visual Intelligence -->

Finally, this job is a natural step in my academic career. I have been engaged in all scientific positions at UiT, PhD - Post Doctoral research fellow, and now researcher.
<!-- Furthermore

I have been working with machine learning and different applications since 2011 when I started my masters degree

I am at present actively engaged in the development of the new electronic health record database and a permanent position would consolidate this.  -->
