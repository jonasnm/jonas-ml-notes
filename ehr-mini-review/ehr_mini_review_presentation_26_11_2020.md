# Interesting papers and directions
After reviewing a lot of papers... :

- Time series (multivariate, missing etc), a la KKW and KÃ˜M
- NLP
- Graph based methods
- (Combinations of the above)

---
# Time series

# Data sets

[eICU dataset](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/)

[Mimic](https://mimic.physionet.org/)

[Mimic 4](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/0.4/) -- August 2020. Also has "hospital-wide" data, which might be worthwhile checking.

"Quake 2" -- In progress
